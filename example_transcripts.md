## Summary of Intent Detection & Confirmation Logic

### Intent Detection Rules:
1. **READ**: Query, search, show, check, find, what, which
2. **CREATE**: Create, add, order, place, new, buy
3. **UPDATE**: Update, change, modify, edit, set
4. **DELETE**: Cancel, remove, delete
5. **GENERAL**: Greetings, thanks, help, unclear messages
6. **CONFIRMATION**: Yes, no, confirm, proceed, cancel (when awaiting confirmation)

### Confirmation Requirements:
- ✅ **CREATE operations**: Always require confirmation
- ✅ **UPDATE operations**: Always require confirmation
- ✅ **DELETE operations**: Always require confirmation
- ❌ **READ operations**: No confirmation needed (non-destructive)
- ❌ **GENERAL conversation**: No confirmation needed

### Intent Adaptation:
- Agent re-evaluates intent on **every message**
- Seamlessly handles intent changes mid-conversation
- Maintains context while adapting to new intents
- Gracefully handles confirmation cancellations
- Provides clear feedback on all state changes
